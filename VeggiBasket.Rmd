## Introduction

Every Tuesday, I pick up a basket of assorted vegetables from a local farm. The contents is a surprise - the season and the harvest abundance dictate what we get. Out of curiosity, I decided to inventory my deliveries by vegetable type and weight, and then use that data to generate various graphs, etc.
